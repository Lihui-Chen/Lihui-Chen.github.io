Hi, I am **Lihui Chen (陈黎辉)**. [cite_start]I am currently an Assistant Researcher at the [School of Microelectronics and Communication Engineering, Chongqing University](http://www.cqu.edu.cn/), China.

[cite_start]I received my Ph.D. degree in Information and Communication Engineering from **Sichuan University** in 2022, advised by Prof. Xiaomin Yang[cite: 7]. [cite_start]During my Ph.D., I was a visiting student at the **National Research Council of Italy (CNR)** from 2021 to 2022, working with Dr. Gemine Vivone and Prof. Jocelyn Chanussot[cite: 7, 8].

My research interests include:
* [cite_start]**Image Restoration & Enhancement** (图像复原与增强) 
* [cite_start]**Image Fusion** (图像融合, especially Hyperspectral/Multispectral) [cite: 1, 8]
* [cite_start]**Deep Learning & Multimodal Large Models** (深度学习与多模态大模型) 

I am looking for self-motivated Master's students to work on Computer Vision and Remote Sensing.
